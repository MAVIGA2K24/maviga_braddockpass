Hello everyone,

I collapsed the Braddock Pass Tunnel to the north and set up a construction site at both tunnel entrances. The tunnel is now impassable and all traffic is diverted onto the parallel carriageway. The construction site is deliberately designed, with construction vehicles at the tunnel entrances to add realism. The diversion leads to increased traffic and traffic jams, which makes passage more difficult and chases particularly exciting.

The new traffic conditions and construction sites now make it much more difficult for speeders to drive through the area undisturbed. This also provides an ideal opportunity for tactical maneuvers and clever ambushes.
